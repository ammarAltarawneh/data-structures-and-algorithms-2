# Depth First

## Summary
The DepthFirst method in the Graph class is used to perform a depth-first traversal of a graph data structure. 

Depth-first traversal is a technique used to explore all reachable nodes from a starting node in a systematic manner, prioritizing traversal as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Approach & Efficiency
### Approach:
The method uses recursion to traverse the graph. It starts from a specified node, marks it as visited, explores its neighbors, and continues this process until all reachable nodes are visited.
### Efficiency:
The time complexity is O(n).
The space complexity is O(n).
